=========

All of the GraphJSON file format and specifications are located [here](https://github.com/GraphAlchemist/GraphJSON/wiki)

See GraphJSON in action [here](http://graphjson.io/)

GraphJSON is a standard format for Graph visualization, similiar to GeoJSON, for geographical maps.

There are a number of different graph file formats - GEXF, GDF, GML, .csv, Pajek Net, GraphML, etc.  For web based graph applications, a standardized graph format is needed so that applications can automatically render graphs with pre-specified layouts, visualization layers, colors, and other attributes.
